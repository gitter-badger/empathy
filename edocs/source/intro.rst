Introduction
============

Welcome to the Empathy PHP MVC framework project documentation. 

About The Project
-----------------

PHP is a relatively straightforward programming language, yet since PHP 5.3 and the introduction
of namespaces it has become more sophisticated in the sense that it is now possible for such
things as a standards-compliant autoloader and to create code that adheres to it.  This in 
essence makes PHP a much more modular language and Empathy seeks to embrace that and me a straightforward
framework that is as interoperable as possible while still attempting to support components that aren't.

Empathy attempts to a simple glue-like framework.
