<h3 style="clear: both;">Hooray For Sex - 09/04/2007</h3>
<p>I'm pleased to announce that episode 4 of our wonderful podcast is finally 'in the can' and will hopefully be edited and released very soon.
The episode features a last minute guest appearance from Tim Hill (of <a href="http://bivouac1927.blogspot.com">bivouac</a> fame) and we get to talk to him about all sorts of things, such as what eggs symbolise in an almost-post-bliarite society.  Subscribe to the podcast on the Hooray For Sex page.</p>

<h3>Get Fresh, Get Naked - 05/04/2007</h3>
<p>I had no idea but it seems like it's <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/">CSS Naked Day</a>.
So off with the fancy style and back to the good old fasion Web 1.0 way. By the way, for those not in the know, CSS is a web development technique for separating style from content;
usually achieved by having all of the styling code stored in separate files.  It's also the stuff that get's produced (and which you then need to copy and paste), when you decide to 'pimp your profile' or whatever it's called. It's all enough to bring a tear my eye. Function over form, forever  :'( </p>

<h3>Stuck On You - 29/03/2007</h3>
<p><strong>Get Crucial</strong>'s song 'Planes' will be out soon on a cover-CD,
stuck to the front of an upcoming edition of Artrocker magazine. More details soon.</p>
