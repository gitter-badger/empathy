Abbas ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Maliki al-Hasani al-'Idrisi al-Makki</h2>

<h1>MANIFESTO</h1>

<p>Who accepted the current world order? You did. Yes you. Welcome to the post life, post sex,
post human hell we call our existence and we could careless for it. We are payless. God is
sick. God does not know what made him. God is lonely. Adrift. We are god. We are nothing.
My flat mate offered his X box to me last night for ten pounds for weed. I declined the offer
and returned to the yellow pages. The people are sick it said in tiny italics that old people
canâ€™t read. They never needed the truth they were working the land. They have all they ever
desired. It is not a distraction that is too emotive. This is a request for all drivers. Put on your
gloves and drive. Drive it to her. Have drive for her or him. Did you enjoy your unisex? Belief
is a funny thing. Clinical delivery is paramount. Dominos. We understand heritage and there
is no comparison. We have enough knowledge to say that information is infinite so come to
the eternal medium sized broadcaster. We operate on the in between which no doctor has
considered. Hello livid Wednesday. The era of berserk is upon us rip us apart like Siamese
twins one has to be sacrificed one has to die. Nobody has ever played the drums it is true.
We are politicians.</p>

<p>No more humiliation, subjugation and dehumanization, just animals leaving. Vacating
premises.</p>

<p>We cannot be used any longer tie us up.</p>

<p>Pledge allegiance.</p>
